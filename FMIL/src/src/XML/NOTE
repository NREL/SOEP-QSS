If FMILIB_BUILD_LEX_AND_PARSER_FILES is set in the cmake build, the resulting
generated sources has to be modified by hand. Lines containing the following
content:

#ifndef YY_NO_UNISTD_H
/* Special case for "unistd.h", since it is non-ANSI. We include it way
 * down here because we want the user's section 1 to have been scanned first.
 * The user has a chance to override it with an option.
 */
#include <unistd.h>
#endif

needs to be updated to:

#ifndef YY_NO_UNISTD_H
/* Special case for "unistd.h", since it is non-ANSI. We include it way
 * down here because we want the user's section 1 to have been scanned first.
 * The user has a chance to override it with an option.
 */
#include <unistd.h>
#else
/*windows compatibility case*/
#include <io.h>
#define isatty _isatty
#define fileno _fileno
#endif
